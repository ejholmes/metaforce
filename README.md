# Metaforce [![travis-ci](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ejholmes/metaforce.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ejholmes/metaforce)

Metaforce is a Ruby gem for interacting with the [Salesforce Metadata API](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_meta/index.htm).
The goal of this project is to make the [Migration Tool](http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_deploying_ant.htm) obsolete, favoring Rake over Ant.

[Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/metaforce/frames)

## Installation
```bash
gem install metaforce
```

## Usage
``` ruby
client = Metaforce::Metadata::Client.new :username => 'username',
    :password => 'password',
    :security_token => 'security token')

# Describe the metadata on the organization
client.metadata_objects
# => [{ :child_xml_names => "CustomLabel", :directory_name => "labels" ... }]

# List all custom objects
client.list(:custom_object)
# => [{ :created_by_id => "005U0000000EGpcIAG", :created_by_name => "Eric Holmes", ... }]

# Deploy metadata to the organization
deployment = client.deploy(File.expand_path('path/to/src'))
# => #<Metaforce::Transaction:0x00000102779bf8 @id="04sU0000000WNWoIAO" @type=:deploy> 

# Get the result
deployment.result
# => { :id => "04sU0000000WNWoIAO", :messages => [{ :changed => true ... :success => true }

# Retrieve the metadata components specified in package.xml and unzip to the "retrieved" directory
client.retrieve(File.expand_path('path/to/package.xml')).to('retrieved')

# Create a Visualforce page
client.create_apex_page(:full_name => 'TestPage', :label => 'TestPage')

# Update a Visualforce page
client.update_apex_page('OldName', :full_name => 'NewName')

# Delete a Visualforce page
client.delete_apex_page('TestPage')
```

## Roadmap
This gem is far from being feature complete. Here's a list of things that still
need to be done.

* Implement command line utility that can watch the directory and deploy when a
  file changes.
* Implement some helper methods for diffing metadata.
* Ability to deploy directly from a git repository.
* And some other stuff that I haven't quite thought of yet...

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute code, please fork the repository and implement your
feature on a new branch, then send me a pull request with a detailed
description. Please provide applicable rspec specs.
